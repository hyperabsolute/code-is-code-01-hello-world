If it works like it should, it is awesome.
If it does not, I need a brain transplant... or something is broken and I will fix it.

     HAS HAPPENED BEFORE, AND IT WILL
     HAPPEN AGAIN... BUT IT DOESN'T
     MATTER - BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS
     TOGETHER. EVERY PATH IS THE RIGHT
     PATH: EVERYTHING COULD HAVE BEEN
     ANYTHING ELSE, AND IT WOULD HAVE
     JUST AS MUCH MEANING. ENJOY. SHARE.
